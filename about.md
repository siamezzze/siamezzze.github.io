My name is Maria Glukhova, I am 22 years old and currently I am at the last year of M.Sc. studies at two universities: [Southern Federal University](http://sfedu.ru/index_eng.php), Russia and [Lappeenranta University of Technology](http://www.lut.fi/web/en/), Finland (double degree program). The focus of my studies is Computer Science and Computer Vision.

I was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, but now I temporary live in Lappeenranra, Finland.

I am interested in software engineering, data science and machine learning. My main programming language is Python. In my spare time, I play video games (mostly RPGs), read books and occasionaly play flute at jam sessions.

At the moment, I am taking part in [Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy) winter internships (December 6 to March 6, 2017), working on Debian [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) project, and my blog posts are about my progress there.
