Hello!
I am Maria Glukhova, student from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), studying intelligence computing.

I was selected to be an [Outreachy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/) intern for December-March this winter. I will work with Debian Reproducible Builds team, improving existing tools that can be used to check reproducibility of packages.

In this blog, I will keep updates about how my internship is going.
